# Side-Channel-Attack-for-AES256-Power-Traces
This project is a Correlation Power analysis, which is a type of SCA performed on AES256 cryptography algorithm power traces.
AES 256 is considered the most secure encryption algorithm available as of today.  AES 256 has a 256-bit key size, giving a probability space of 2^56 possible combinations of keys.10 rounds of encryption almost makes it impossible for a classical computer to break this encryption.Assuming 1000 cycles are required to check a single key, a 2GHz computer checks 2 million keys per second. A classical computer would take 1.75*10^63 years to run a brute force attack and retrieve all keys “successfully”. Hence, this method employs SCA that involves attackers analyzing and exploiting leaked side channel information like timing data, power data, or electric and magnetic emanation profiles to gain access to the keys itself.
